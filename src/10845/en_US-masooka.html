		<p>Implement a queue that stores integers, and write a program that
			processes commands given as input.</p>

		<p>There are six types of commands:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>push $X$: An operation that puts the integer $X$ into the
				queue.</li>
			<li>pop: Removes the integer at the front of the queue and prints
				it. If there are no integers in the queue, print &minus;1.</li>
			<li>size: Prints the number of integers in the queue.</li>
			<li>empty: If the queue is empty, print 1; otherwise, print 0.</li>
			<li>front: Prints the integer at the front of the queue. If there
				are no integers in the queue, print &minus;1.
			</li>
			<li>back: Prints the integer at the back of the queue. If there are
				no integers in the queue, print &minus;1.</li>
