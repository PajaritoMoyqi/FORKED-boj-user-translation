		<p>Sejun failed his final exam and decided to manipulate his scores
			before taking them home. First, he chose the highest score among his
			grades, denoting this value as $M$. Then, he adjusted all his scores
			using the formula $\text{score}/M \times 100$.</p>

		<p>For example, if Sejun's highest score was 70 and his math score was
			50, then his math score is recalculated as $50/70 \times 100$, resulting
			in 71.43.</p>

		<p>Write a program that calculates Sejun's new average score using the
			method described above.</p>
