		<p>It is said that the number 666 represents the apocalypse. Therefore,
			many blockbuster movies often use titles containing 666. Director Schom,
			the creator of the <q>End of the World</q> series, decides to name his
			movies differently to surpass directors like George Lucas and Peter
			Jackson.</p>

		<p>An <em>apocalyptic number</em> is a number that contains at least
			three consecutive 6s. The smallest apocalyptic number is 666, followed
			by 1666, 2666, 3666, and so on. Accordingly, Schom names his first movie
			<q>End of the World 666</q>, the second movie <q>End of the World
				1666</q>, and so forth. In general, the title of the $N$th movie in
			the series is <q>End of the World</q> followed by the $N$th smallest
			apocalyptic number.
		</p>

		<p>Write a program to output the number in the title of Schom's $N$th
			movie. Note that Schom always produces these movies in order and does
			not make any other movies.</p>
