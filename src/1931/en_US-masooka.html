		<p>There is one meeting room available, and there are $N$ meetings that
			want to use it. For each meeting, a start time and an end time are
			given. The goal is to find the maximum number of meetings that can use
			the meeting room without any overlap. Once a meeting starts, it cannot
			be interrupted, and a new meeting can start immediately after the
			previous one ends. Note that the start and end times of a meeting can be
			the same, which means the meeting starts and ends instantly.</p>

			end times of the meetings. The start and end times are natural numbers
