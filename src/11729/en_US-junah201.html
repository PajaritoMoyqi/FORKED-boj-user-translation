      There are three towers, and on the first tower, there are n disks of
      different radii stacked in descending order. The monks want to move these
      disks from the first tower to the third tower following these rules:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Only one disk can be moved at a time to another tower.</li>
      <li>A stacked disk must always be smaller than the disk below it.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Write a program that outputs the sequence of moves required to complete
      this task, ensuring the number of moves is minimized.
    </p>
    <p>Below is an example when there are 5 disks.</p>

      The first line contains the number of disks N (1 &le; N &le; 20) stacked
      on the first tower.

    <p>Output K, the number of moves, on the first line.</p>
    <p>
      From the second line onward, output the sequence of moves. For K lines
      starting from the second line, print two integers A and B separated by a
      space, indicating that the top disk of the A-th tower is moved to the top
      of the B-th tower.
