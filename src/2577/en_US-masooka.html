		<p>Given three natural numbers A, B, and C, write a program that calculates the product A × B × C and determines
			how many times each digit from 0 to 9 is used in the result.</p>
		<p>For example, if A = 150, B = 266, and C = 427, then A × B × C = 150 × 266 × 427 = 17037300. In the result
			17037300, the digit 0 is used 3 times, the digit 1 is used once, the digit 3 is used twice, and the digit 7
			is used twice.</p>
