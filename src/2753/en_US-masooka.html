		<p>Write a program that prints 1 if the given year is a leap year, and 0
			otherwise.</p>

		<p>A leap year occurs when the year is a multiple of 4 but not a
			multiple of 100, or when it is a multiple of 400.</p>

		<p>For example, the year 2012 is a leap year because it is a multiple of
			4 but not a multiple of 100. The year 1900 is not a leap year because it
			is a multiple of 100 but not a multiple of 400. However, the year 2000
			is a leap year because it is a multiple of 400.</p>
