		<p>We want to rank people's sizes by their weight and height. A person's
			size is represented as $(x, y)$, where $x$ is the weight in kg and $y$
			is the height in cm. If person A's size is $(x, y)$ and person B's size
			is $(p, q)$, then A is considered to have a <q>bigger size</q> than B if
			$x > p$ and $y > q$. For example, if the sizes of A and B are (56, 177)
			and (45, 165) respectively, A is considered to have a bigger size than
			B. However, there are cases where it's not possible to determine who has
			a bigger size. For instance, if C and D have sizes (45, 181) and (55,
			173), respectively, D is heavier but C is taller, so we cannot say who
			has a bigger size just based on
			<q>size</q>.
		</p>

		<p>In a group of $N$ people, each person's size rank is determined by
			the number of people with a <q>bigger size</q> than them. If there are
			$k$ people with a bigger size than someone, that person's size rank is
			$k+1$. This way, it's possible for multiple people to have the same size
			rank. Below is a table showing the size and rank of each person in a
			group of 5 people.</p>

		<p>In the table above, since there is no one with a bigger size than C,
			C is ranked 1st. A, B, and D are all ranked 2nd as the only person with
			a bigger size than each of them is C. E, being smaller than A, B, C, and
			D, is ranked 5th. In this case, there are no ranks 3rd and 4th. Your
			task is to read the weight and height of $N$ students from the input and
			calculate each person's size rank.</p>
