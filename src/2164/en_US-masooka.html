		<p>There are $N$ cards. Each card is numbered from 1 to $N$ in order,
			with the 1st card on top and the $N$th card at the bottom.</p>

		<p>The following actions are repeated until only one card remains:
			Firstly, the top card is discarded. Then, the new top card is moved to
			the bottom of the stack.</p>

		<p>For example, consider $N = 4$. The cards are initially arranged in
			the order 1234 from top to bottom. Discarding 1 leaves 234. Moving 2 to
			the bottom results in 342. Discarding 3 leaves 42, and moving 4 to the
			bottom results in 24. Finally, discarding 2 leaves card number 4.</p>

		<p>Given $N$, write a program to find out which card remains at the
			end.</p>
