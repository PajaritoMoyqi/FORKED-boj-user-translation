      KOI Telecommunications Research Institute is conducting experiments to
      develop a new secret communication system using lasers. For the
      experiment, they set up N towers with different heights along a straight
      line in order, from left to right. A laser transmitter is installed on the
      top of each tower, and every tower's transmitter sends a laser signal
      horizontally to the left, parallel to the ground. Additionally, each tower
      has a receiver installed on its structure to capture any incoming laser
      signals. The laser signal sent from one tower can only be received by the
      first tower it encounters to its left.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, suppose there are five towers with heights of 6, 9, 5, 7, and
      4, arranged in a straight line from left to right. Each tower
      simultaneously emits a laser signal in the opposite direction of their
      order (to the left). The laser signal emitted from the fifth tower with
      height 4 will be received by the fourth tower with height 7, the signal
      from the fourth tower with height 7 will be received by the second tower
      with height 9, and the signal from the third tower with height 5 will also
      be received by the second tower with height 9. The laser signals from the
      first and second towers, with heights 6 and 9 respectively, will not be
      received by any other towers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Given the number of towers N and their heights, write a program to
      determine which tower receives the laser signal from each tower.

      The first line of input contains an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 500,000), the
      number of towers. he second line contains N integers representing the
      heights of the towers in order from left to right, separated by a single
      space. Each tower's height is an integer between 1 and 100,000,000,
      inclusive.

    <p>
      For each tower, in the order given, output the number of the tower that
      receives its laser signal. If no tower receives the signal, output 0. The
      results should be printed in a single line, with each value separated by a
      space.
