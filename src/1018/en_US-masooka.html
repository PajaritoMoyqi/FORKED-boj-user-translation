		<p>Jim found a board in his mansion that is divided into $MN$ unit
			squares, making up an $M \times N$ board. Some squares are painted
			black, while the rest are painted white. Jim wants to cut this board to
			make an $8 \times 8$ chessboard.</p>

		<p>A chessboard must have alternating black and white squares.
			Specifically, each square is either black or white, and two squares
			sharing a side must be of different colors. Therefore, following this
			definition, there are only two ways to paint a chessboard: one with the
			top-left square white and the other with it black.</p>

		<p>Since there is no guarantee that the board is already painted like a
			chessboard, Jim thinks he needs to repaint some squares after cutting
			it into an $8 \times 8$ chessboard. Naturally, he can choose any $8
			\times 8$ area. Write a program to determine the minimum number of
			squares Jim needs to repaint.</p>
