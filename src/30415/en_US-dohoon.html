				<p>In the Cat League, teams consisting of cats compete against each other.</p>

<p>The International Cat Sports Federation has specified the conditions that a team must satisfy:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The team must have $m$ players.</li>
	<li>Each player's price is an integer ranging from $1$ to $n-1$ (inclusive).</li>
	<li>The prices of any two different players must be distinct.</li>
	<li>The least common multiple of the prices of any two players is $n$.</li>
</ul>

<p>A wealthy cat conglomerate has recently taken an interest in the Cat League and decided to establish a new team.</p>

<p>They entrusted the team management to Yeongchul, who is in need of quick funds. Yeongchul plans to assemble the team with minimal expenses and pocket the rest.</p>

<p>Help Yeongchul determine a team that meets the approval criteria while minimizing the sum of the players' prices, ensuring the team is approved!</p>

								<p>The team composed of players with player prices $33$, $6$, and $22$ satisfies the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The team has $m (=3)$ players.</li>
	<li>The player prices $33$, $6$, and $22$ are all less than or equal to $n-1 (=65)$.</li>
	<li>$33$, $6$, and $22$ are distinct.</li>
	<li>The least common multiple of any pair of player prices matches $n (=66)$.
	<ul>
		<li>The least common multiple of $33$ and $6$ is $66$.</li>
		<li>The least common multiple of $33$ and $22$ is $66$.</li>
		<li>The least common multiple of $6$ and $22$ is $66$.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Therefore, it is possible to obtain approval from the International Cat Sports Federation.</p>

<p>Additionally, there is no other team composition with a lower sum of player prices that satisfies the approval criteria of the International Cat Sports Federation.</p>
