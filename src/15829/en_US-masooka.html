		<p>Welcome to APC. If you have taken a data structure course at school,
			you would have learned about hash functions. A hash function is defined
			as a function that takes an arbitrary length of input and produces a
			fixed length of output. Hash functions have a myriad of applications,
			notably in data storage and search.
		</p>

		<p>In this problem, we aim to teach you a useful hash function. For
			convenience, let's assume that the incoming string consists only of
			English lowercase letters (a, b, …, z). Since there are 26 letters in
			English, we can assign unique numbers such as 1 for &lsquo;a&rsquo;, 2
			for &lsquo;b&rsquo;, 3 for &lsquo;c&rsquo;, …, and 26 for
			&lsquo;z&rsquo;. Consequently, we can convert a string into a sequence
			of numbers. For example, the string <q>abba</q> can be represented as
			the sequence 1, 2, 2, 1.
		</p>

		<p>To calculate the hash value, we intend to convert the string or
			sequence into a single integer. Simply, we can sum the values of the
			sequence. Since a hash function should have a finite range of output,
			let's divide it by a suitably large number $M$. Voilà! The hash function
			is now complete. This can be expressed in the formula:</p>

		<p>\[H = \sum_{i=0}^{L-1}{a_i} \mod M\]</p>

		<p>While there can be an infinite variety of strings as input for the
			hash function, the output range is fixed. You might have heard of the
			pigeonhole principle. According to this principle, even if two strings
			are different, they can have the same hash value. This is called a hash
			collision. A good hash function should have minimal collisions. The hash
			function defined above is bad since changing the order of alphabets
			leads to collisions. Let's improve it.</p>

		<p>How can we ensure that changing the order produces a different
			output? A potential solution is to assign a unique coefficient to each
			term in the sequence. A common method is to multiply each term by a
			specific number raised to the power of its index, and then sum the
			results. This can be expressed as:</p>

		<p>\[H = \sum_{i=0}^{L-1}{a_ir^i} \mod M\]</p>

		<p>Typically, $r$ and $M$ are chosen as coprime numbers. Choosing them
			can be tricky, so let's use $r$ as a prime number larger than 26, which
			is 31, and $M$ as 1234567891 (surprisingly, it's a prime number!).</p>

		<p>Your task now is to compute the hash value of the given string using
			the formula above. Even if it seems simple, remember this function as it
			is commonly used.</p>
