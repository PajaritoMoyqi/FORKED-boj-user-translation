		<p>The Josephus Problem is described as follows.</p>

		<p>There are $N$ people numbered from 1 to $N$ sitting in a circle, and
			a positive integer $K$ ($K \le N$) is given. Starting with the first
			person, every $K$-th person is removed from the circle. After a person
			is removed, the process continues around the circle formed by the
			remaining people. This process continues until all $N$ people have been
			removed. The order in which people are removed from the circle is called
			the $(N, K)$-Josephus permutation. For example, the $(7, 3)$-Josephus
			permutation is &lang;3, 6, 2, 7, 5, 1, 4&rang;.
		</p>

		<p>Given $N$ and $K$, write a program to find the $(N, K)$-Josephus
			permutation.</p>
