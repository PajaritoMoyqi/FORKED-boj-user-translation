		<p>Define a function $\text{dig}$ as follows:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>$\text{dig}(x) = x$ for $(0 \leq x \leq 9)$</li>
			<li>$\text{dig}(x) = \text{dig}($sum of all digits of $x)$ &nbsp;$(x \geq 10)$</li>
		</ul>

		<p>For example, $\text{dig}(49) = \text{dig}(13) = \text{dig}(4) = 4$</p>

		<p>Omin has a very old map and is looking for treasure following a pirate's instructions. The old map outlines how to find the treasure.</p>

		<p>Currently, Omin is facing north, and his current position is $(0, 0)$. North is the direction where the $Y$-coordinate increases, and east is the direction where the $X$-coordinate increases.</p>

		<p>Omin can repeat the following steps $K$ times to find the treasure's location. The gold number starts at $1$</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Move forward by the value of $\text{dig(gold number)}$. Then, turn $90$ degrees clockwise.</li>
			<li>Multiply the gold number by $M$.</li>
		</ol>

		<p>Write a program to output Omin's final location, i.e., the treasure's location.</p>
