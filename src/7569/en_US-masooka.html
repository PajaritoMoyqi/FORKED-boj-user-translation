		<p>Charlie's tomato farm has a large warehouse for storing tomatoes. The
			tomatoes are stored in a grid-patterned box, with one tomato per cell,
			and these boxes are stacked vertically in the warehouse, as shown in the
			image below.</p>

		<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt=""

		<p>In the warehouse, there are both ripe and unripe tomatoes. After a
			day, unripe tomatoes adjacent to ripe ones become ripe due to their
			influence. An adjacent position for a tomato refers to the six
			directions: up, down, left, right, front, and back. Tomatoes in diagonal
			directions are not affected, and it is assumed that tomatoes do not
			ripen on their own. Charlie wants to know the minimum number of days it
			takes for all the tomatoes stored in the warehouse to become ripe.</p>

		<p>Given the size of the grid-patterned boxes used for storing tomatoes
			and the information about ripe and unripe tomatoes, write a program to
			calculate the minimum number of days required for all the tomatoes to
			become ripe. Note that some cells in the box might be empty.</p>

		<h2>Input</h2>
	</div>
	<div id="problem_input" class="problem-text">
		<p>The first line contains three integers, \(M\), \(N\), and \(H\),
			representing the size of the boxes and the number of boxes stacked.
			\(M\) is the number of horizontal cells in a box, \(N\) is the number of
			vertical cells, and \(H\) is the number of boxes stacked. It is
			guaranteed that \(2 \le M \le 100\), \(2 \le N \le 100\), and \(1 \le H
			\le 100\). From the second line onwards, the information about the
			tomatoes stored in the boxes from the bottommost to the topmost is
			provided. For each of the \(N\) lines, the state of tomatoes in each row
			of the box is given by \(M\) integers. The integer 1 represents a ripe
			tomato, 0 represents an unripe tomato, and &minus;1 represents an empty
			cell. This information for \(N\) lines is repeated \(H\) times.</p>

		<p>The input is given only when there is at least one tomato.</p>

		<p>You need to calculate and output the minimum number of days it takes
