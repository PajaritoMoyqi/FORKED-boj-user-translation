      Line up sticks of different heights (you may have sticks of the same
      height) andthe same shape, as shown below, and number them from left to
      right. In the example below, the heights of the sticks are 6, 9, 7, 6, 4,
      6. When you look at the sticks from the right, you'll see that some of the
      sticks are visible and some are invisible, meaning that they are behind
      and taller than the ones you see. For example, in this case, we see three
      sticks (6, 3, and 2).

      Given the height information for N sticks, you want to write a program
      that determines how many are visible by looking to the right.

      In the first line, you are given N (2 &le; N &le; 100,000) that represents
      the number of sticks. In the following N lines, you are given h (1 &le; h
      &le; 100,000) that represents the height of each stick.
