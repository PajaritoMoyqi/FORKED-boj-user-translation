      Let's draw stars using a recursive pattern. When N is a power of 3 (3, 9,
      27, ...), the pattern of size N is a square of size N&times;N.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pattern of size 3 consists of a single star in every position except
      for the center, which is a blank space.

      When N is greater than 3, the pattern of size N consists of an
      (N/3)&times;(N/3) square in the center filled with spaces, surrounded by
      the pattern of size N/3. For example, the pattern of size 27 is shown in
      sample output 1.

      The first line contains N. N is a power of 3, meaning N=3<sup>k</sup> for
      some integer k, and 1 &le; k &lt; 8.
