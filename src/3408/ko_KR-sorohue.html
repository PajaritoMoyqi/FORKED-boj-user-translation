<p>A sequence is called non-boring if its every connected subsequence contains a unique element, i.e. an element such that no other element of that subsequence has the same value.</p>

<p>Given a sequence of integers, decide whether it is non-boring.</p>

					<p>The first line of the input contains the number of test cases T. The descriptions of the test cases follow:</p>

<p>Each test case starts with an integer n (1 &le; n &le; 200 000) denoting the length of the sequence. In the next line the n elements of the sequence follow, separated with single spaces. The elements are non-negative integers less than 10<sup>9</sup>.</p>
