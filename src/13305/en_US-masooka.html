		<p>There are $N$ cities in a certain country, all located along a
			straight horizontal road for convenience. One plans to travel by car
			from the city on the far left to the city on the far right. The roads
			between adjacent cities may have different lengths, with the unit of
			length being kilometers (km).</p>

		<p>When starting the journey, the car has no fuel, so it is necessary to
			fill up at a gas station. The fuel tank size is unlimited, allowing one
			to fill as much fuel as needed. The car uses 1 liter of fuel per
			kilometer traveled. Each city has only one gas station, and the price
			per liter of fuel can vary from city to city, with the unit of price
			being dollars.</p>

		<p>For example, consider a country with four cities arranged as in the
			following figure. The number inside the circle is the price per liter at
			the gas station in that city. The numbers on the road represent the
			length of the road.</p>

		<p>If you fill up with 6 liters of fuel in the far-left city and travel
			to the far-right city without further refueling, the total cost is 30
			dollars. However, if you fill up with 2 liters of fuel in the far-left
			city ($2 \times 5 = 10$ dollars), travel to the next city, fill up with
			3 liters ($3 \times 2 = 6$ dollars), then fill up with another liter in
			the next city ($1 \times 4 = 4$ dollars) before traveling to the
			far-right city, the total cost is 20 dollars. Another method is to fill
			up with 2 liters in the far-left city ($2 \times 5 = 10$ dollars),
			travel to the next city, fill up with 4 liters ($4 \times 2 = 8$
			dollars), and then travel to the far-right city, the total cost is 18
			dollars.</p>

		<p>Write a program that calculates the minimum cost to travel from the
			far-left city to the far-right city, given the fuel prices at each
			city's gas station and the lengths of the roads connecting each
			city.</p>

			representing the lengths of the roads connecting two adjacent cities

			representing the per liter fuel prices at the gas stations from the
			leftmost city in order. The distance from the leftmost to the rightmost
			city is a natural number between 1 and 1,000,000,000. The price per
