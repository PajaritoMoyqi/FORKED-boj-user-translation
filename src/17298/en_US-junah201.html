      There is a sequence of size N, denoted as A = A<sub>1</sub>,
      A<sub>2</sub>, &hellip;, A<sub>N</sub>. For each element A<sub>i</sub>, we
      want to find its Next Greater Element (NGE(i)). The NGE of A<sub>i</sub>
      is defined as the leftmost number that is greater than A<sub>i</sub> and
      is located to its right. If no such number exists, the NGE is -1.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, if A = [3, 5, 2, 7], then NGE(1) = 5, NGE(2) = 7, NGE(3) = 7,
      and NGE(4) = -1. In the case of A = [9, 5, 4, 8], we have NGE(1) = -1,
      NGE(2) = 8, NGE(3) = 8, and NGE(4) = -1.

      The first line of input contains an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 1,000,000), the
      size of the sequence A. The second line of input contains the elements of
      the sequence A, A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>, &hellip;, A<sub>N</sub> (1 ≤
      A<sub>i</sub> ≤ 1,000,000).
