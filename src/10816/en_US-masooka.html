	<div id="problem_input" class="problem-text">
		<p>The first line contains the number of number cards Sam has, $N$ ($1
			\le N \le 500\,000$). The second line contains the integers written on
			the number cards. The integers on the cards are greater than or equal to
			&minus;10,000,000 and less than or equal to 10,000,000.</p>
		<p>The third line contains $M$ ($1 \le M \le 500\,000$). The fourth line
			contains $M$ integers separated by spaces, for which you need to
			determine how many number cards Sam has. These integers are also greater
			than or equal to &minus;10,000,000 and less than or equal to
			10,000,000.</p>
