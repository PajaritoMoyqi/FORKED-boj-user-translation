      The outline of buildings visible as the sun sets in a city is called a
      skyline. Can we determine how many buildings are in the city just by
      looking at the skyline? Assume that all buildings are simple rectangular
      shapes.

    <p>
      It is impossible to determine exactly how many buildings there are in most
      cases, but it seems possible to figure out the minimum number of
      buildings. Let's write a program to find out the minimum number of
      buildings.

      The first line of input contains an integer n (1 &le; n &le; 50,000). The
      next n lines each contain the coordinates x and y of the points where the
      height of the skyline changes as viewed from the left. (1 ≤ x ≤ 1,000,000,
      0 ≤ y ≤ 500,000) The x-coordinate of the first point is always 1.
